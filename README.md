# Idea
Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as reverse ≈Åukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands.

# How to use?

Then, you can type a series of numbers and operends in the infile, and the result will be printed in the outfile
